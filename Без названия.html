It\u2019s simple, because everyone will win.\n            \n                \n            \n             \n            \n                window.jwLibrary = \"chM58Ml7\";\n            \n        \nLike many, my business was fortunate to receive credits from AWS. Functioning much like cash, these credits are commonly awarded to companies in their infancy, applied to AWS business accounts as a bonus, offsettable against Amazon products and services consumed.\nThis March, Amazon announced they were committing $20 million worth of credits to companies and teams working on a response to COVID-19, an initiative I of course applaud and support.\u00a0\nHowever many startups and scale-ups are fighting for their survival too and I believe Amazon is uniquely placed to make a dramatic impact on the global tech community with one swift, easy to implement gesture. And others agree.\u00a0\nI corralled over 200 founders of startups and scale-ups in Europe, North America and India within 24 hours, all AWS customers, to join me in asking Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon\u2019s AWS, for his help. I also created a petition in case you\u2019d like to lend your support too.\nHere\u2019s why it\u2019s a win:win for us all.\u00a0\n1. Demonstrate serious commitment to startups\nGiving out AWS credit is a quick, easy, and impactful way Amazon can show its customers across the world how important our business is to them.\n2. Relieve our cash flows\nMany companies need urgent support and suppliers are extending any hand they can to aid cash preservation, runway extension, and for many, survival. Credits will immediately provide some welcome relief to our cash flows.\n3. Our survival is critical to AWS\u2019s business\nThere\u2019s a symbiotic relationship between AWS and its customers. Survival of the startup ecosystem is critical not just to global economic recovery but to Amazon too. In helping its startup and scale-up customers survive, Amazon thereby ensure customers continue to need to consume their services.\u00a0\u00a0\n4. Win loyalty, market share, and new customers\nAWS\u2019s business already has millions of customers but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to cement customer loyalty and potentially increase market share. \nGenerously offering additional credits will resonate not only with existing customers and build unprecedented brand loyalty but will also demonstrate to companies thinking of moving providers, that AWS is the supplier of choice. \nThere are thousands of founders across the globe conceiving tomorrow\u2019s startups, contemplating whose services and products to consume. What better advert and what more compelling reason can AWS offer a potential customer than this show of support? And what more authentic reason could AWS give existing customers to stay loyal than by supporting them now?\u00a0\n5. It\u2019s quick and easy\nAmazon has all our information. They know what we spend on an ongoing basis. The USA\u2019s COVID financial subsidies such as the Payroll Protection Program and Economic Disaster Loans under the Cares Act, the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme in the UK and Government backed initiatives all over the world require huge amounts of information to be submitted and validated. AWS has all the data on startups they need at hand.\nI am asking AWS to offer us all additional credits based on the last 12 month\u2019s spend. Help us \u2026 based on how much business we do with you. \nReward your loyal customers. Offering us all, say, the equivalent of one quarter\u2019s standard usage based on the last 12 months of consumption would be a spectacular way you can help us through this difficult time.\u00a0\nFounders and CTOs, please help demonstrate that this initiative is vital to you too by joining hundreds of others and signing my letter to Andy here on change.org.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd Andy if you\u2019re reading this, I know you need to secure your own business, have many demands on your time and are already helping COVID initiatives \u2013 but we the startup and scale-up community need your help too.\u00a0","copyrightYear":"2020","sourceOrganization":{"@id":"http:\/\/data.thenextweb.com\/tnw\/entity\/the_next_web"},"copyrightHolder":{"@id":"http:\/\/data.thenextweb.com\/tnw\/entity\/the_next_web"},"interactionStatistic":[{"@type":"InteractionCounter","interactionService":{"@type":"Website","name":"Twitter","url":"http:\/\/www.twitter.com"},"interactionType":"https:\/\/schema.org\/ShareAction","userInteractionCount":0},{"@type":"InteractionCounter","interactionService":{"@type":"Website","name":"Facebook","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com"},"interactionType":"https:\/\/schema.org\/ShareAction","userInteractionCount":0},{"@type":"InteractionCounter","interactionType":"https:\/\/schema.org\/CommentAction","userInteractionCount":"0"}],"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/cdn0.tnwcdn.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/1\/files\/2020\/04\/AWS-Amazon.png","width":1200,"height":628}}</script>

                                <p><span>I’m writing this public plea to ask AWS CEO Andy Jassy to extend additional credits to startup and scale-up customers at this critical time, even those who have received them in the past. </span></p>
<p><span>And why should AWS give out free credit? It’s simple, because everyone will win.</span></p>

<p><span>Like many, my business was fortunate to receive credits from AWS. Functioning much like cash, these credits are commonly awarded to companies in their infancy, applied to AWS business accounts as a bonus, offsettable against Amazon products and services consumed.</span></p>
<p><span>This March, Amazon announced they were committing </span><a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/innovation/aws-launches-initiative-to-accelerate-covid-19-diagnostics-research-and-testing?utm_source=social&amp;amp;utm_medium=tw&amp;amp;utm_term=amznnews&amp;amp;utm_content=COVID-19_AWSResearch" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>$20 million worth of credits</span></a><span> to companies and teams working on a response to COVID-19, an initiative I of course applaud and support. </span></p>
<p><span>However many startups and scale-ups are fighting for their survival too and</span> <span>I believe Amazon is uniquely placed to make a dramatic impact on the global tech community with one swift, easy to implement gesture. And others agree. </span></p>
<p><span>I corralled over 200 founders of startups and scale-ups in Europe, North America and India within 24 hours, all AWS customers, to join me in asking Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon’s AWS, for his help. I also created a </span><a href="https://www.change.org/p/andy-jassy-ceo-amazon-web-services-aws-s-ceo-can-give-oxygen-to-startups-right-now?recruiter=91425330&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>petition</span></a><span> in case you’d like to lend your support too.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s why it’s a win:win for us all. </span></p>
<h2><b>1. Demonstrate serious commitment to startups</b></h2>
<p><span>Giving out AWS credit is a quick, easy, and impactful way Amazon can show its customers across the world how important our business is to them.</span></p>
<h2><b>2. Relieve our cash flows</b></h2>
<p><span>Many companies need urgent support and suppliers are extending any hand they can to aid cash preservation, runway extension, and for many, survival. Credits will immediately provide some welcome relief to our cash flows.</span></p>
<h2><b>3. Our survival is critical to AWS’s business</b></h2>
<p><span>There’s a symbiotic relationship between AWS and its customers. Survival of the startup ecosystem is critical not just to global economic recovery but to Amazon too. In helping its startup and scale-up customers survive, Amazon thereby ensure customers continue to need to consume their services.  </span></p>
<h2><b>4. Win loyalty, market share, and new customers</b></h2>
<p><span>AWS’s business already has millions of customers but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to cement customer loyalty and potentially increase market share. </span></p>
<p><span>Generously offering additional credits will resonate not only with existing customers and build unprecedented brand loyalty but will also demonstrate to companies thinking of moving providers, that AWS is the supplier of choice. </span></p>
<p><span>There are thousands of founders across the globe conceiving tomorrow’s startups, contemplating whose services and products to consume. What better advert and what more compelling reason can AWS offer a potential customer than this show of support? And what more authentic reason could AWS give existing customers to stay loyal than by supporting them now? </span></p>
<h2><b>5. It’s quick and easy</b></h2>
<p><span>Amazon has all our information. They know what we spend on an ongoing basis. The USA’s COVID financial subsidies such as the Payroll Protection Program and Economic Disaster Loans under the Cares Act, the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme in the UK and Government backed initiatives all over the world require huge amounts of information to be submitted and validated. AWS has all the data on startups they need at hand.</span></p>
<p><span>I am asking AWS to offer us all additional credits based on the last 12 month’s spend. Help us … based on how much business we do with you. </span></p>
<p><span>Reward your loyal customers. Offering us all, say, the equivalent of one quarter’s standard usage based on the last 12 months of consumption would be a spectacular way you can help us through this difficult time. </span></p>
<p><span>Founders and CTOs, please help demonstrate that this initiative is vital to you too by joining hundreds of others and signing my letter to Andy </span><a href="http://chng.it/PrCrsN9pzz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>here on change.org</span></a><span>.   </span></p>
<p><span>And Andy if you’re reading this, I know you need to secure your own business, have many demands on your time and are already helping COVID initiatives – but we the startup and scale-up community need your help too. </span></p>
